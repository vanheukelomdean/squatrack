### Description 

This project is an application of human pose estimation used for analysis of power lifting form. Proof of concept will first be prototyped using the tensorflow/opencv python api, trained on the mpii datatset, then the trained model will be packaged and deployed for mobile.

The current solution is an implementation of this [2016 research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00134), however the implementation may be reconsidered using motion tracking for improved frame rate
